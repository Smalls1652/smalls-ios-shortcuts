# Smallsâ€™ iOS Shortcuts

This is my repository of iOS Shortcuts I have created.

## Shortcuts List

### Nutrient Sync

**Description**: Nutrient Sync is an iOS Shortcut I made to get around the privacy concerns and subscription based focus of most calorie tracking apps. This utilizes your iCloud Drive to store data and iOS Health to sync the data.

**Current Version**: _0.1.1_

### Estimated Arrival Time
